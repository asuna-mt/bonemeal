Bonemeal mod [bonemeal]

This mod adds two new items into the game, bones which can be dug from normal
dirt and bonemeal which is crafted from bones and player bone blocks.

Bonemeal can be used on added saplings for a 1 in 2 chance to grow them quickly
as well as specified crops which are grown 1 to 4 steps at a time.  Dirt can
also be clicked for random grass, flowers or registered decoration to appear.

The api.txt document shows how to add your own saplings, crops and grasses to
the list by using one of the 3 commands included and the mod.lua file gives you
many examples by using some of the popular mods available.
